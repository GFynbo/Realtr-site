        <h3>The Inspiration</h3>
        <p> <!--text in between paragraph tag-->
          What's the most stressful thing on your mind after finding a job right after college? <br> <br> Coming straight out of college, attempting to be an independent adult, but not knowing the next steps
          to move and find a place to live in a brand new location. <br> <br> We wanted to simplify this process. <br> <br> We created a bot that would streamline this difficult time for these seniors so they would be less stressed when
          kickstarting their exciting careers in a foreign place. Since half our team consists of seniors, we wanted to create a project that was practical and helped us (& other graduating seniors) in this
          very same situation.
